    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I came up with this recipe after having fish tacos from a street vendor in Ensenada, Mexico. It is the closest to authentic I have found. Salsa can be made a day in advance for flavors to blend.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>6 tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced green chiles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canned diced jalapeno peppers
        </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>3 cups coleslaw mix</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ranch dressing        </li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 (9 ounce) box batter mix (such as Shore Lunch®)</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Mexican beer</li>
        <li>24 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 pound cod fillets, cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
        <li>2 limes, sliced into wedges</li>
        <li>1 dash chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®) (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now to the steps!</p>

    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalapeno peppers, 1 tablespoon juice from jalapeno peppers, and garlic salt in a bowl; squeeze 1/2 lime over salsa fresca. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate while preparing fish.</li>
        <li>Toss coleslaw mix with ranch dressing in a bowl; set aside for flavors to blend.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir batter mix and beer together in a bowl. Wrap corn tortillas in wet paper towels and set aside.</li>
        <li>Dip cod in the batter mix; fry coated cod in batches in the hot oil until cod is cooked through and coating is brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove cod with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Stack two tortillas on a plate; top with fish, a sprinkle of Mexican cheese, coleslaw mixture, salsa fresca, and a squeeze from lime wedge. Drizzle with chile-garlic sauce. Repeat with remaining ingredients.

        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Cook's Notes: </h3>
    <p>Soaking your fish filets in cold salt water for 30 minutes before rinsing well and patting dry will eliminate any fishy smell or taste. I have used shredded cabbage in place of the bagged coleslaw too, but I find the flavor to be too strong. I think the bagged mix has had time to off-gas so it does not overpower the dish.</p>
